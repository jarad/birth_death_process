This applet will simulate a birth-death process (queueing system).

## Input

- Queueing system
  - M/M/k
  - M/M/Inf
  - Poisson process (M/0/Inf)
- Number of servers (k) in M/M/k system
- Birth rate (B)
- Death rate (D)
- Initial state, X(0)
- End time for simulation (T)
- Number of simulations (N)

## Plot

The plot is the current value of the state X(t) for t in the interval (0,T) repeated for N simulations.
